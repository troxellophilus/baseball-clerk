## To-Do

* better user agent in requests (use session objects maybe?)
* due up
* text faces
* ~~run against all baseballbot run threads rather than just one subreddit?~~
  * ~~exclude/include lists (in case of alternate bot)~~
* better readme
* comments (the reddit kind)
* docstrings
* ~~active game threads only~~
* pitching changes & substitutions
* hit expectancy ('great play')
* stats command
